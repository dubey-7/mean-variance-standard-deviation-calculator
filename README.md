# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

📊 Interactive Mean–Variance–Standard Deviation Calculator

This project is an interactive statistical analysis tool built with Python and NumPy. It converts user input into a structured 3×3 matrix and instantly calculates key metrics such as:

📈 Mean
📊 Variance
📉 Standard Deviation
🔢 Minimum & Maximum
➕ Sum

In real-world data analysis, these calculations are essential during Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, identify patterns, and validate datasets before applying machine learning or business analytics techniques.

🚀 The project highlights practical skills in data manipulation, matrix operations, and statistical computation used in real analytics workflows.

## 📊 Project Objective

Create a function named `calculate()` that:

- Takes a list of 9 numbers as input
- Converts it into a 3x3 NumPy array
- Returns a dictionary containing:
  - Mean
  - Variance
  - Standard Deviation
  - Maximum
  - Minimum
  - Sum

Each calculation is performed:
- Along rows
- Along columns
- For the entire matrix (flattened)
